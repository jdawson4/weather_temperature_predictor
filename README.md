# Weather/Temperature Predictor

This project will take a few datasets I found online and apply some machine learning to them to see if we can make predictions about future temperatures/weather conditions. I'm mostly hoping to see what kinds of predictions I can make from what kind of data--perhaps in the future I'll be able to apply what I/the machine has learnt to make my own weather predictions on local data!
